# HomlessStudy

NHANES or the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a program that is conducted year round to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. It is a combination of interviews and physical examinations. Participants are rewarded with incentives to provide their answers and are even given free transportation. 

Here is the information if you want to look more into it https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm

The Menstrual health of homeless women is not something that is widely researched. This population of women have not been of particular interest to researchers for many of year. Therefore, we know little about their health and even more so their menstrual health. By collecting data using surveys and interpreting it in R we will be able to establish certain characteristics of these women that can be used to make inferences about their menstrual health status. This research is not only important for the safety of homeless women but also will provide insight on targeting the issue of homelessness.

Additionally, I am using a package called "NHANES" that is the data collected from 2009 to 2010 and contains 20,293 observations with 75 variables of each participant. Since I am working on a menstrual health in homeless women study we will be using NHANES to compare national data to our data set of homeless women and will select a few variables that pertain to our study.

You will need to download my exel document of all the data collected on homeless women in Charleston that I will provide in the data section of my github account. Once it is downloaded you can click and upload file to your global environment.
