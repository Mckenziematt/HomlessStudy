#So when you run this chunk above. Make sure to look into the console and interpret it from there
# When using an R markdown it wont show you the whole table
#This table shows that there is a difference in women 

# I know this is difficult to interpret but when looking at the table we can infer that most of our young women had gone to college or had some form of college (62%) 
#Meanwhile (37%) did not
#If we relate this too our homeless women study we can infer that they obviously have educational disparities compared to the larger population
