#Recoding Variables
```{R}
HomelessClean<-na.omit(Homeless)
HomelessClean
```

```{r}
#So now I have characterized Concern for Safety as a numeric variable. This will allow me to run correlation test and other univariate and multivariate stats
HomelessClean$ConcernForSafety <- as.numeric(factor(HomelessClean$ConcernForSafety,
                                                  levels = c('Never', 'Rarely', 'Sometimes', 'Always')))


```


```{r}
#WE want to change our education variable to numeric as well
HomelessClean$Education <- as.numeric(factor(HomelessClean$Education,
                                             levels = c('High school/GED', 'Technical/ trade school or community college', 'Undergraduate university degree (Bachelorâ€™s)')))
```

```{r}
HomelessClean$HealthPerception <- as.numeric(factor(HomelessClean$HealthPerception,
                                             levels = c('Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Very good', 'Excellent')))
```

```{r}
HomelessClean$Race <- as.numeric(factor(HomelessClean$Race,
                                        levels = c('White', 'Black or African American', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'American Indian', 'Hebrew Israelite')))
```

#SHAPIRO WILK TEST: tells us if data is normally distributed
```{r}
shapiro.test(HomelessClean$NumberPregnancies)
#pvalue is less than .05 so data is normally distributed
#Bivariate

by(HomelessClean$NumberPregnancies,HomelessClean$MenstrualCycle,shapiro.test)
#Data is not normaly distributed between Menstrual cycle and number of pregnancies

shapiro.test(HomelessClean$ConcernForSafety)
#This is normally distributed bc p is less than .05
by(HomelessClean$ConcernForSafety, HomelessClean$MenstrualCycle,shapiro.test)
#This tells us that concern for safety is normally distributed for Women that are menstrating and those that are not
by(HomelessClean$Race, HomelessClean$MenstrualCycle,shapiro.test)
#race is normally distributed among women who are menstrating and not menstrating
```

#Correlation Test
```{r}

#Now I wanna see the Correlation between certain variables: this gives us an understanding on how much variables are related
#Were gonna use a Kendalls tau (nonparametric correlation) because our sample size is relatively small
#Pvalue less than .05 then they are correlated
#You dont have to run all of these but just try a few (numeric) variables and see what you get

cor.test(HomelessClean$Age,HomelessClean$ConcernForSafety,alternative="two.sided", method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95)


cor.test(HomelessClean$NumberPregnancies,HomelessClean$ConcernForSafety,alternative="two.sided", method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95)


cor.test(HomelessClean$Age,HomelessClean$ConcernForSafety,alternative="two.sided", method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95)

cor.test(HomelessClean$Age,HomelessClean$NumberPregnancies,alternative="two.sided", method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95)

cor.test(HomelessClean$Education,HomelessClean$NumberPregnancies,alternative="two.sided", method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95)

cor.test(HomelessClean$NumberPregnancies,HomelessClean$HealthPerception,alternative="two.sided", method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95)

```

#Correlation Matrix
```{R}

#Shows us the correlation among all variables at once
cor(HomelessClean[,c('Age','ConcernForSafety','Education','NumberPregnancies','HealthPerception')],method = "kendall")

#This  makes it easier for us to find correlation between certain variables
#Health Perception and Education seem to be correlated as well as Concern for Safety and Health PErception
