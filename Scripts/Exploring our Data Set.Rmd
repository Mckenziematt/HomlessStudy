#so when we compare this to our NAHANEs data histogram of number pregnancies we see that number of pregnancies varied greately where our NHANEs data showed that the average amount of preganncies was 3
#When we ran our univariate stats it said that the mean number of pregnancies was arond 2 thats probably becuase we have some women that reported having none, maybe because they couldnt get pregnant or not financially stable enough to have one, and this was skewed with women who have had too many pregnancies because they maybe have not been able to access pretection
